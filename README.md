Seems working but needs some fixes. I will try to do it but I can't participate in any development because I couldn't find a job in this field, but I would like to contribute. This is for educational purposes only. This is for my graduation project.

Code woks as 5 run for parfor (2 to 6 cores) and than gives us a timing. Than 5 times for single cpu core. Than 5 times with GPU.
I dont know is it fair but Cuda is coded with C++ and matlab with Matlab's coding. Cuda works for 5 sec, Cpu is works for ~4 mins for same results.
